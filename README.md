### Introduction
- WalkWize is an application that will suggests pedestrian walking routes to avoid forecasted congestion in Melbourne, Australia.
- The user can input their end points, when in the next 24 hours they wish to leave, and input of how risk averse they are.

### Access
- Online: [walkwize.herokuapp.com](walkwize.herokuapp.com/)


### Data
- __pedestrian:__
Historic and real-time pedestrian data from the [City of Melbourne](http://www.pedestrian.melbourne.vic.gov.au/)

- __street map:__ Walkable paths were generated from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) using the [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/) package.


### Example
- After the user enters their end points, when they wish to leave, and how crowd averse they are, the app shows both the shortest route (grey) and an optimized route (blue), as well as some statistics about the two routes.
